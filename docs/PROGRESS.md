## Current Status
**Phase Completed**: 7/8 (87.5%)
**Next Priority**: Phase 8 - Testing & Quality (Unit tests, UI tests, integration tests)

## Recent Major Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
### Library Data Sync Issue Resolution (2025-08-07)
- **Root Cause**: DataManager.performInitialSync() was never called, leaving local database empty
- **Solution**: Added sync trigger in MainActivity after user authentication
- **Impact**: All Library tabs (Songs, Albums, Artists, Playlists) now populate with data

### API Endpoint Configuration Issues (2025-08-07)
- **Root Cause**: Missing `/api` prefix in endpoints caused 404 Not Found errors
- **Solution**: Updated KorusApiServiceProvider to automatically append `/api/` to base URLs
- **Impact**: All API calls now work correctly with proper URL structure

### Song Streaming Authentication Issues (2025-08-07)  
- **Root Cause**: ExoPlayer HTTP requests lacked Authorization headers causing 401 Unauthorized
- **Solution**: Added authentication to ExoPlayer's HttpDataSource via PlayerModule
- **Impact**: Song streaming now works with proper authentication

### Audio Playback Issues (2025-08-07)
- **Root Cause**: Missing audio permissions and no auto-play functionality
- **Solution**: Added MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS permission and auto-play in setQueue()
- **Impact**: Songs now play automatically when tapped with proper audio output

## Technical Debt & TODOs
