  - [x] Updated LibraryViewModel and HomeViewModel to use all repositories
  - [x] SearchViewModel with parallel search across all content types
  - [x] NowPlayingViewModel with complete player controls and queue management
  - [x] SettingsViewModel with user preferences and logout functionality
  - [x] AlbumDetailViewModel, ArtistDetailViewModel, PlaylistDetailViewModel for detail screens
  - [x] Updated ViewModelModule with proper Koin DI configuration
- [x] **Database Schema Fixes**: Fixed PlaylistSongEntity to use proper ID field matching API
- [x] **Mapper Updates**: Complete data mappers for all DTOs and entities

## Previous Updates - API Alignment âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Contextual Wrapper Pattern**: Updated app to match server's new API design
  - [x] Albums include nested songs array in single call
  - [x] Artists include nested albums and top tracks
  - [x] Playlists include full song details with position metadata
- [x] **DTO Updates**: Created PlaylistSongDto, TopTrackDto for new API structure
- [x] **Repository Updates**: SongRepositoryImpl uses single-call API approach
- [x] **Field Alignment**: Fixed playlist request DTOs to use `visibility` instead of `is_public`
- [x] **Server Documentation**: Fixed API documentation inconsistencies in server repo

## Current Status
**Phase Completed**: 6/8 (75%)
**Next Priority**: Phase 7 - Performance & Polish (Image loading, optimizations, error handling)
