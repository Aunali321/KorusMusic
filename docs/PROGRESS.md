  - [x] Complete KorusApiService matching the server API
  - [x] DTO models for all API responses
  - [x] Network configuration with JSON serialization
- [x] **Domain Layer**: Define domain models and repository interfaces
  - [x] Domain models (Song, Album, Artist, Playlist, User, PlayHistory)
  - [x] Repository interfaces for clean architecture
  - [x] Data mappers between DTOs, entities, and domain models
- [x] **DI Setup**: Configure Koin modules for all layers
  - [x] NetworkModule, DatabaseModule, RepositoryModule
  - [x] Complete dependency injection setup

## Phase 3: Authentication & Security âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] Implement JWT token management with DataStore
- [x] Create AuthInterceptor for automatic token attachment
- [x] Create TokenAuthenticator for automatic token refresh
- [x] Implement AuthRepository with login/logout functionality
- [x] Set up secure token storage with encrypted preferences

## Phase 4: Music Player Service âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] Create foreground `MusicService` with ExoPlayer integration
- [x] Implement `PlayerManager` abstraction for playback control
- [x] Set up media caching with ExoPlayer's `CacheDataSource`
- [x] Create `PlayerServiceConnection` for UI-service communication
- [x] Add media session and notification controls

## Phase 5: UI Implementation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Navigation**: Set up Navigation Compose with type-safe routing
- [x] **Theme**: Implement Material 3 theming with light/dark mode support
- [x] **Core Screens**: Login, Home, Library, Search, Now Playing, Settings
- [x] **ViewModels**: Implement state management for each screen following MVVM pattern

## Phase 6: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹ PENDING
- [ ] Implement playlist creation, editing, and reordering with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Add offline support with WorkManager for background sync
- [ ] Create user library features (liked songs, followed artists)
- [ ] Implement listening history and statistics tracking
- [ ] Add search functionality with real-time results

## Phase 7: Performance & Polish ðŸ“‹ PENDING
- [ ] Set up Coil for optimized image loading with caching
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations (lazy loading, pagination)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize database queries and caching strategies

## Phase 8: Testing & Quality ðŸ“‹ PENDING
- [ ] Write unit tests for repositories, managers, and ViewModels
- [ ] Create UI tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Add integration tests for API communication
- [ ] Implement proper logging and crash reporting

## Current Status
**Phase Completed**: 5/8 (62.5%)
**Next Priority**: Phase 6 - Advanced Features (Playlists, offline sync, search functionality)

## Technical Debt & TODOs
- [ ] Complete remaining repository implementations (Album, Artist, Playlist)
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning for production builds
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for existing components
- [ ] Optimize Room queries for better performance
- [ ] Add proper logging framework

## Key Achievements
1. âœ… **Solid Foundation**: Complete dependency setup with modern Android libraries
2. âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with MVVM + Clean Architecture
3. âœ… **Robust Data Layer**: Comprehensive Room database with proper relationships
4. âœ… **Secure Authentication**: JWT token management with automatic refresh
5. âœ… **Type-Safe Networking**: Complete Retrofit API integration with serialization
6. âœ… **Dependency Injection**: Modular Koin setup for testability and maintainability
7. âœ… **Professional Media Playback**: ExoPlayer integration with background service
8. âœ… **Modern UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 design and navigation
9. âœ… **Complete User Flow**: Login, library browsing, music playback, and settings

## Notes
